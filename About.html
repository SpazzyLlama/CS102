      <h2>My Journey in Game Design</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Spazzy Llama, an aspiring game designer and developer with a passion for creating immersive and engaging interactive experiences. My journey into game development began with a fascination for how virtual worlds are built and the stories they can tell. I thrive on problem-solving and bringing creative ideas to life, from initial concept to polished prototype.</p>

      <p>I specialize in (or am learning) **Unity Engine** development, with a foundational understanding of C# scripting. My interests span across various genres, including adventure, strategy, and indie games that push the boundaries of conventional gameplay. I believe that great games combine compelling narratives, intuitive mechanics, and artistic vision.</p>
